Reflection: I liked doing this project because it was a way to link some of the games we had been working over the year (like Mastermind and Battleship) into one project with other games. Overall, there are six games in this project: Hangman, Twenty Questions, Mastermind, Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship. There were several challenges, but some of the hardest ones were, firstly, trying to integrate the game we had already finished into this project. Each of those games had their own main class, so I had to figure out how to make the code inside those main classes into seperate methods instead which could then be called from the main class of this project. Another challenge was getting the diagonals in Connect Four, which, unlike Tic Tac Toe, I couldn't check each of the diagonal spaces statically. I needed to use a for loop and slope to check for every combination without getting an Index Out Of Bounds Error. It was a great moment to finally figure out these challenges as well as get the project to be fully-functioning.
